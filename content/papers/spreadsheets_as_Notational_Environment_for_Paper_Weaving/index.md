##### Abstract

This work explores how spreadsheets can serve as the foundation for the creation of a hybrid design medium for paper weaving. The case for using spreadsheets as a model for the development of environments for designing paper weaving patterns is made. Firstly, because both spreadsheets as well as the woven form of paper weaving designs have cells as their elementary substrate. Secondly, because it allows for exploration of the design space. And thirdly, as it enables use by end-users with varying levels of experience. An environment, VisiWeave, implementing the points mentioned is presented and explored.
