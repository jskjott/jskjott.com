Here is a collection of spells!

## Five Ws and one H

Five ws and one h is a method for establishing context.

- **Who** is the project team? Who are we working with? Who is involved? 
- **What** is the core challenge? What is the goal? What knowledge are we using?
- **When** is the deadline? When do we do different tasks? 
- **Why** this project? Why this project now?
- **How** are we executing this project? How are we making decisions? How are we evaluating this project?

## MoSCoW

[MoSCoW](https://www.agilebusiness.org/dsdm-project-framework/moscow-prioririsation.html) is a prioritisation technique borrowed from Agile. For scoping priorities. 
The letters stand for:

- **M**ust Have — vital, if it is not there the project should not be done
- **S**hould Have — important but not vital
- **C**ould Have / Nice to have — desirable but less important
- **W**on’t Have this time — agreed upon things that project won't have

## Lightweight social rules for learning spaces

The Recurse Center has some [nice social rules](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules) which adress some of the behaviour which can be destructive to a good learning(or projecting) environment.

- **No feigning surprise** "You shouldn't act surprised when people say they don't know something."
- **No well-actuallys** "A well-actually happens when someone says something that's almost - but not entirely - correct, and you say, "well, actually…" and then give a minor correction."
- **No back-seat driving** "If you overhear people working through a problem, you shouldn't give advice unless you’re actively participating in the conversation."
- **No subtle -isms** "Our last social rule bans subtle racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and other kinds of bias."

## Decision memos

[Decision memos](https://shorensteincenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/MEMO-WRITING-HO-ALL-Danziger.pdf) are short documents describing a problem, a solution, and how the solution was arrived at.

1. Define the problem 
2. Summarise your findings
3. Step back and show how you got there
